# Blackjack Clone

This is a clone of **Blackjack** that I originally built in 2018 while taking the [Rice University Python course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python). The original version was written in Python2.7 and used a text-based interface.

I updated the code to Python3 and added a `tkinter` GUI.

### Features
- Classic Blackjack gameplay
- GUI built with `tkinter`
- Score tracking

### How to Run

```bash
python3 blackjack-gui.py
